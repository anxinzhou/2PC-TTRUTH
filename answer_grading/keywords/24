last elements function meaning twice original value stored assigned time values declare array call new returned static first
arrays used referenced object also array creating static accessed
function destroyed terminates time also created array declared static
element local arrays c encountered initialized program declarations cannot members non compiler created array zero programmer static first
arrays program size execution remain static

time called created array declared static
times duration function elements program time declaring even called multiple values array declared declaration static
local elements arrays initialized zero explicitly automatic
elements initialized non array zero explicitly static
changed cannot static
space cannot size assigned set array data static
hiding conflicts allowing information member global naming public private prevents namespace static
else duration local elements exists 0 initialized program later arrays automatic called still something specifically array explicitly static
leave input arrays open known later used program size whereas assigned non purposes undeclared declared usually static
function arrays time end non values static
arrays function terminates initialized program automatic called values created destroyed static
calls function ends initialized program time created destroyed
calls created function initialized time declared declare array destroyed static
duration exists program array static
array declared static
removed terminates function exists program automatic normal memory created array static
