value stored assigned declare call static elements original function use returned first reset meaning twice new array last store time values
array object static referenced accessed also used without creating arrays
array initialized terminates destroyed static created also time declared function
intialized members all non intializes static zero program first encountered cannot c explicityly compiler programmer array earch declarations created element local initialized arrays
program size static throughout execution remain arrays
program array non initilization static initilized reaches line
end array program declaration scope available beginning static within accessed w right declared disappears one
array dynamic size static gets cannot runtime pre changed
array called static created time declared
array initialize declaration program times called static every throughout even multiple time declaring store values elements declared function duration
all automatic happen local zero elements initialized explicitly arrays
all array non static zero elements initialized explicitly
cannot changed static
all array space beyond assigned size static cannot data need could change go set may
prevents naming conflicts global static allowing member namespace private information put public hiding
automatic unless array program arrays something happen 0 called else static local elements explicitly later initialized still specifically exists duration
program purposes open non assigned known size static usually whereas leave input later used declared arrays undeclared
end reinitialize non keep static every time values arrays function
automatic program terminates called destroyed static created reset everytime initialized values arrays function
program destroyed calls every created time initialized function ends
array initialized destroyed declare calls static every created time declared function
program array static exists duration
declared array static
automatic array program terminates normal memory static whereas created removed function exists
