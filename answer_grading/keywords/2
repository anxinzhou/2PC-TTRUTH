extensibility smaller problems components maintainability reduces reusable large manageable
inheritance objects operations time execution combine classes appropriate properties data encapsulation polymorphism
reusability easier
usability ease maintenance
advantages one time method classes known objects technique works polymorphism inheritance main earlier program cannot execution combine data finally details advantage inner defined operations appropriate encapsulation
maintenance program reused existing classes easier verification
different using easier allows debugging modules
methods use functions concept data encapsulation
solution general modular view deployment code faster solutions reusable allowing
times smaller problem problems working one object assigned reused shared time encounter much hassle modules programs abstraction solving creating breaking repeated compiler debugging programming incorrectly simpler unique looks function organized maintenance coding several many art redundant also complex post big easier code usually
