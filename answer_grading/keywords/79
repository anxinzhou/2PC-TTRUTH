polynomial gt 2 complexity time using log exponential n 1 big k linear quadratic
sort algorithm operations counting using number performed principle
algorithm parameters certain means given time takes experimental prototype actually
running algorithm measuring input sizes different relationship
runtime possibilities algorithm test hardware assessment recommended used limited code theoretical data first
answered
running measuring equation tells time using approach big experimental
times algorithm measuring run create time takes multiple amount results average
function value operations time takes called many
oh big
running input measuring system program various time data
running hardware x different time patterns run software important 10 theoretical testing increase completion program inferior eyes makes data measure however sizes speeds experimental
runtime times based function program called many thing
times specific get called number unit work segments
equation add n memory type call
adding algorithm efficiency cpu time called immediately speed change computers marker
notation big h
running seconds time actual measures approach experimental
running algorithm specific set data
running algorithm measured expressed function required operations time terms notation number big experimental usually
lowest times example running x time constant f n number 1 code values drop average 3n
running input program operations time actual using done
