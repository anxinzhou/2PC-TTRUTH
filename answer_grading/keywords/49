last element function head pointed pointer pop list changes points previously recently removes implement next pushed
elements 3 similar implementation list pushing end stack function program using displaying element insertion see linked pop operations 2 popping 1 push deletion performed single
track nodes head pop using needed push stack
item modify head pop top push new stack
element item pointer list changing top implement next removing new stack first
space need create grows long stack
nodes head pointer list points linked beginning
element deleting add list pushing popping top linked stack creating
singly address head moving list way already linked stack depends lot
head list end bottom top make
function add pop list stack beginning
nodes head pop top use push
item based list node points next
last item head list adds push added new
last item items elements head pop list empty needed end top push new stack
adding element last one list end takes popping sets previous links
element arrays list node using next point use pointers becomes linked stack
inserted elements head removed header pointer list node current
track item pointer list points linked first
last lifo storage singly item used simply first list easily members popped already linked data stack pushed
pointer using
top pointer first
