end pointer modify update called add element time linked top list
onto implement head pointer pointed last recently pushed pop point changes element removes previously function points next list
see deletion linked pushing displaying stack_display end 1 similar elements function performed list operations push program single insertion implementation stack delete_end insert_end popping pop 3 using element 2
push nodes head needed pop keep using stack track create
use push head item pop would stack add modify new remove top
implement move pointer item first changing stack element removing top new next list
long space stack grows create need dynamicly
head pointer nodes remove declare beginning add linked points list
deleting popping stack add element linked creating pushing top list
already depends head singly moving lot way address stack linked list like
end head add bottom top make list
use pop beginning stack add function remove list
use push head nodes pop top
item node create based points next list
push head added item last new adds list
unless push head end item last needed pop items stack create elements top new empty remove list
links end adding one sets popping last previous element takes list
implement use point using stack element node becomes linked next arrays list pointers
head pointer inserted node elements current removed header list
use pointer item first keep track linked points list
already singly first pushed item last storage easily stack lifo data simply used linked popped list members
using pointer
pointer first top
move entered pointer array back delete last keep pointing front element
