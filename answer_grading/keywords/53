data structure c collection data kept order first first
queue list objects particular order read one time starting first followed second
queue abstract data structure operations performed both ends giving queue first first behavior
queue stores set elements particular order principle operation fifo first first means first element inserted first one removed
adt whose first inserted item first item removed uses fifo idea items enter queue back leave front

like stack uses linked list stack little differently fifo first thing enqueued first thing dequeued
first first abstract data type used store values
stores set elements particular order first first principle
object stores elements order follows first first first element added first one come
quese list stores set elements particular order stack principle case first first first element inserted first element removed
finite ordered list zero elements based upon first first
data structure performs operations order first first fifo
queue first first data structure first element added also first removed
queue buffer store element particular order
stores set elements first element first element removed
data structure removes nodes head adds nodes tail
