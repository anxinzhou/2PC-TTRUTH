refining possibly design testing phase reveals problems design production affected program unworkable current form lead later production time originally estimated also affects coding testing may need rewrite code program remove errors
implementation phase maintenance phase effected
verification coding refining solution maintenance all influenced testing stage
rup stages software life cycle influenced testing stage elaboration phase refined progject vision iterative devilopment core system development system requirements accurate time cost estimates construction phase iterative development remaining system transition phase testing deployment system
refining solution production maintenance all influenced testing stage
elaboration construction transition all affected testing
refining production maintenance
refining solution
verification debugging
refining coding
second half elaboration phase construction phase transition phase
refining step production step maintenance stage

refining
testing stage direct influence final version program debugging finalization software revision
directly refining coding refining right testing phase coding right testing phase indirectly production maintenance refining occurs last two stages software life cycle
testing refining production maintenance
depending work done testing spread throughout process prevent errors showing later due lack foresight
elaboration construction transition
all stages influenced except setting program requirements test fails change whole design implementation etc program well final outcome
refining production maintenance
coding refining
refining production maintenance
removing logical errors testing valid data random data actual data
