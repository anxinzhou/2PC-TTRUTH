high risk problems address prototype program make sure program feasible prototype may also used show company software possibly programmed
simulate portions desired final product quick easy program small specific job way help see problem may solve final project
prototype program simulates behaviors portions desired software product allow error checking
defined specification phase prototype stimulates behavior portions desired software product meaning role prototype temporary solution program refined used extensively problem solving
used let users first idea completed program allow clients evaluate program generate much feedback including software specifications project estimations total project
find problem errors program finalized
address major issues creation program way account all possible bugs program possible prove program tangible
break whole program prototype programs simulate parts final program
provide example model finished program perfom provides forsight challanges would encountered provides opportunity introduce changes finished program
simulating behavior portion desired software product
program stimulates behavior portions desired software product
program simulates behavior portions desired software product
lay basics give starting point actual problem solving
simulate problem solving parts problem
prototype program provides basic groundwork enhance improve solution problem
prototype program part specification phase software problem solvin employed illustrate key problem problems solved program sometimes serves base program expand upon
program simulates behavior portions desired software product
provides limited proof concept verify client actually programming whole application
tests main function program leaving finer details
get early feedback users early stages development show users first idea program look like make sure program meet requirements intense programming begins
simulates behavior portions desired software product
simulates behavior portions desired software product
prototype program used problem solving collect data problem
ease understanding problem discussion ease understanding program
