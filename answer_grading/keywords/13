reusable functions area
functions classes used
contents storage file header includes put names h act called pulling retrieval use functions mainly allows container hat peek
file separate source referenced easily actual different employed content code programs modules reusable
file header used list members functions data
cross file header thus source program size communication fairly hard method individual 1 large code lump files
source use code classes reusable contains
methods function main included source program coding usability allows code classes direct
file header source code reusable files
file details c main definition readability also class
compiler elsewhere classes used
file header functions class declares available data
header used files multiple code contain
