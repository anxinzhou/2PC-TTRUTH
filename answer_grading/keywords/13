role header file list all functions class hiding inner workings functions
main role header file used share information among various files
header files separate files classes defined allow compiler recognize classes used elsewhere

header file consists reusable source code class file convention h filename extension differs cpp files contain source code
provide information contents library includes definition classes declarations functions data types constants
header file shows user types go come function allow user manipulate actual code function
header files declares class member functions
header file allows separation declaration implementation separate files
header file access c standard library makes certain classes like class string work

include hat h allows use hat container called act pulling names hat header file hat includes functions storage retrieval contents mainly put peek pull
hold reusable content modules separate actual source code file easily referenced employed different programs
header file file used store list prototye functions data members
header file cross communication method source files help limit size individual program without header files program 1 large lump code thus fairly hard debug traverse
contains reusable source code use classes
separate source code main function allows methods classes included program without direct coding allows usability
header files reusable source code file programer use
hide definition details class also help readability main c file
allow compiler recognize classes used elsewhere
header file declares class data functions available class
header files contain code used multiple files
