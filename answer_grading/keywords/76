coquer back solved means together problem solution problems final merged divide dividing whole 2
problem conquer divides easier paradigm divide portions solve smaller
merge sort works conquer recur elements divide quicksort
program times conquer easier problem multiple groups half divide whole work solve extent
one sepereate lines replace order easily larger smallers values divide manipulate string line
parts problem address manageable proceed problems split smaller
program components conquer breaking dived solve small complex large easy
incident solving problem larger smallest dividing
units easier structures sub data manipulate break large smaller
array tackle breaks conquer problem technique run sorting algorithm elements divide takes smaller
two approach works pieces separately faster piece problem conquer divides allowing separate paradigm problems divide 2 smaller
solving process problem divide take thus whole solve smaller
problem idea half problems solve split smaller
answer splits solves together conquer problem simpler point simple paradigm problems solutions divide merges large
solved refers conquer separating easier simple algorithm problems act divide complex large abstraction relatively smaller
two splits makes better faster problem easier readability solutions takes large
splitting problem simpler taking larger problems smaller
units singular works solved piece problem divides
backwards parts back works give halves together easier compare divides problem putting easily solution whole comparing smaller
two parts part works item conquer divides data paradigm divide found indiviually takes
program modify conquer problem n idea easier read problems making divide take large split smaller
halves dividing conquer problem case reached paradigm base keeps divide recursive solution
two solving conquering means together problem breaking putting both problems solutions dividing smaller
