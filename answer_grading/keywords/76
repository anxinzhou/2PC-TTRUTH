example equal halves element elements process conquer repeats n splits array divide
whole together problem problems solution means 2 dividing final solved merged divide
smaller problem divides portions conquer easier divide paradigm
sort elements conquer recur divide works merge quicksort
times whole problem program half multiple extent easier groups divide
one line easily larger order values lines string
smaller problem problems parts split manageable
breaking dived program components easy complex conquer small large
problem dividing larger smallest solving incident
break smaller units sub structures easier data large
algorithm smaller problem elements takes conquer technique array divide sorting
piece two problem allowing smaller separate divides separately problems 2 conquer approach faster divide paradigm works pieces
whole thus smaller problem process solving
smaller problem problems idea split half
simpler together problem problems solves conquer merges point splits solutions divide simple paradigm large
algorithm separating problems smaller act conquer complex solved easier divide simple large relatively refers
two problem makes readability takes better splits easier faster solutions large
simpler smaller problem problems taking larger splitting
units piece problem divides singular solved works
halves whole smaller problem comparing parts together divides solution easily putting backwards easier back works
item two parts divides part takes found conquer works divide paradigm data
smaller problem problems idea making split program conquer n easier divide large
