example array n elements divide conquer splits array equal halves repeats process element
divide coquer means dividing problem 2 problems solved merged back together final solution whole problem
divide conquer paradigm divides problem smaller smaller portions easier solve
divide elements recur conquer works merge sort quicksort
divide conquer divide program half multiple times extent program whole easier work groups solve problem
divide one larger string line values sepereate smallers lines easily manipulate replace order
split problem smaller manageable parts proceed address smaller problems
dived conquer breaking large complex program small easy solve components
dividing larger problem smallest incident problem solving smallest incident
break large data structures smaller sub units easier manipulate
divide conquer technique takes sorting algorithm breaks array smaller elements array tackle problem run algorithm
divide conquer paradigm divides problem two pieces works piece separately allowing faster approach 2 separate smaller problems
take problem divide smaller problem solve smaller problem divide smaller problem solve thus solving whole problem process
idea split problem half solve smaller split problems
divide conquer paradigm splits large problem simpler problems point solves simpler problems merges simple solutions together answer large problem
divide conquer refers abstraction act separating large complex problems smaller easier problems solved relatively simple algorithm
takes large problem splits two easier faster solutions makes better readability
taking larger problem splitting simpler smaller problems
divides problem singular units works problem piece piece problem solved
smaller parts easier compare comparing whole divides problem halves easily compare works backwards putting back together give solution
divide conquer paradigm takes data divides two parts works part indiviually item found
idea divide conquer take large problem split n smaller problems making program easier read modify
divide conquer paradigm recursive solution keeps dividing problem halves base case reached
dividing conquering means breaking problem two smaller problems solving both putting two solutions together
