onto end push one pop front node elements list unlimited
power knows continue value im processing items method infinite periods still uses one crazy job scheduling long implement theoretically required nonstop position extended raise larger practical add full elements queue place option counter use item goes memory would downside another ways used two array queues adding could ever element ecetera almost remove shift term read
onto pointer head back tail item recently least added inserted front items also removed implementing list points
use represent items queue list
dequeue use pointer last first enqueue together items element insert link elements list
dequeue end head enqueue beginning items linked list
use end first point items element insert queue remove list
remains pointer back item first assigned poiner front items add become utilizing new queue points next
implement nodes head added tail retrieved allows linked list
check add elements empty list
delete back keep front both add track linked make list
head item last insertion beginning listed point making queue list
head tail data take throw
dequeue push head nodes pointer functions basically pop enqueue create top list substituting
pointer linked current enque end deque hte add create list use delete fairly singly first item temporary que new make next head tail temp element easy
use long one back empty front linked queue 2 list pointers
continue first get input next node data create add elements element new set dequeueing list
use nodes principles removed must first pointer could called head stack element always also linked queue contain top list
1 keep enqueueing checking front rear elements linked equal list
two head tail track implemented keeping queue list pointers
nodes head added tail allocated dequeued coming element elements linked new queue list
dequeue implement operation retrieve 1 getfront queuefront remove list
head reference first second element new remove list
end nodes adding beginning removing creating list
