elements one unlimited node list end front
theoretically item items elements one im downside full method use memory knows long periods used nonstop goes job almost read larger crazy ever position two value practical processing queues array raise counter queue uses adding element extended place required infinite option power still scheduling ways term
item inserted items implementing head removed pointer list also points recently least front added back tail
items list queue
last element together items elements pointer list link first
items head list end linked beginning
remove element items insert list end point use queue first
item items add pointer remains assigned points front back next new utilizing queue first
nodes head retrieved list allows added implement linked tail
add list elements empty
track keep list delete front back linked
last item insertion head making list listed point beginning queue
tail throw data head
nodes head pointer create list pop top functions push basically substituting
item temporary use new tail create list que temp hte first add pointer easy current next element singly head fairly delete linked
one 2 list long empty pointers front back linked queue
element input new elements continue list node next data first
element nodes removed always head must pointer list also principles top called use linked stack queue first
equal elements keep list rear checking 1 front linked
track two head tail list implemented pointers keeping queue
element nodes elements head tail list coming added linked new allocated queue
list 1 implement operation retrieve
element second head list new first
adding nodes list end beginning creating removing
