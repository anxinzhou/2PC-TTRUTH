elements inserted link list point need resized unlike array needs
unlike arrays linked lists insert delete without shifting data change size easily
array size fixed linked fixed
insert delete items pointer based linked list without shifting data
arrays must defined size elements added linked list w defining size
principal benefit linked list conventional array order linked items may different order data items stored memory disk allowing list items traversed different order linked list self referential datatype contains pointer link another datum type linked lists permit insertion removal nodes point list constant time
expand need predetermine size
linked lists able grow shrink size needed
linked list able grow size needed require shifting items insertions deletions
linked list fixed size require shifting items insertions deletions
limit many create array hold given amount information
linked lists constant time insertion deletion
linked lists grown dynamically items require shifting greater awesome factor arrays
linked lists indefinite size added taken away easily little difficulty shifting data
nearly infinite size limited system memory also ability expand size dynamically
grow needed arrays fixed size
fixed size linked list able grow needed time access array bases list takes contant amount time linked base like depends
linked lists grow shrink need arrays fixed size
memory allocated fly items
linked list may increased size needed array size set created
array fixed size linked list able grow size needed
resizeable
linked lists set size grow shrink needed
linked lists abe grow needed new size
