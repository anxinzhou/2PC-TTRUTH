function calls upon self solve problem time calls upon self splits problem simplier form reaches base case simplest form problem
function calls perform opperation factorial recursive function
answered
base case calls upon problem becomes smaller terminates
function calls runs multiple times base case reached
function calls untill reaches base case
function calls time must get smaller eventually must converge base case otherwise start infinite loop
function calls base case met
function calls function call problem diminished
function calls perform certain task
recursive function function calls usually called base case base case correct causes infinite loop
function calls order solve problem
function calls finds simplest form solution base case
recursive function function calls repeatedly base case achieved fundamental idea break one large problem series smaller similar problems
recursive function typically simplifies problem calling arriving base case recursively returns solution
recursive function function breaks large problem two smaller problems calls solve smaller problems base case terminating point reached base case definite answer called function longer recurses unwinds back function calls determine answer original large problem
function calls loop base case loop exit
function calls base cases met
recursive function knows solve base cases recursive function calls directly indirectly base case reached
function calls uses base case stop recursion
function calls eaach calls get closer close base case
function divides conquers problem base case eventually reached function calls base case satisfied
function calls definition code
recursive function solves problem repeatedly calling initial problem broken successively smaller parts much simpler base case reached solutions piece problem returned step time
