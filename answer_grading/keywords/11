one per class
many want long different parameters
limit number constructors class like functions constructors overloaded
depends type class defined typically would constructor call object
c constructor overloaded one constructor class different parameters
1
number want
one
default one may overloaded create many constructors necessary
many want
many want different parameters
infinite
many need
many needed depending many variables one wishes directly modify leave default instantiating object
large amount constructors created given class overloading two constructors different type number parameters created said overloaded c recognize constructor use based type variables passed returned
depends number objects object constructor
theoretically unlimited long defined programmer
many needed
many wanted needed
several

one
infinite constructors long signature different
depends number data members class
