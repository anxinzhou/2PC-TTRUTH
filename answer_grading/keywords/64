tree data structure node value total order defined values left subtree contains values less parent node vice versa right subtree
binary search tree binary tree value node n greater value every node n left subtree less every node n right subtree
binary tree value node n greater value every node n left subtree less value every node n right subtree
binary tree search key node n greater search key node n left subtree less search key node n right subtree
tree split based values makes easy search one compare desired value root root greater search left side tree less search right side thing recursively
tree node two nodes node left less root node right greater root
special binary tree rule all subtrees right smaller node value all subtrees left larger node value
binary search trees similar binary trees implemented organize data specific way later searching
binary tree node value total order defined values left subtree node contains values less node value right subtree node contains values greater equal node value
binary tree data organized specific arangment
binary search tree tree also condition node may maximum 2 children input data compared data tree starting root value smaller root traverses left larger traverses right becomes leaf
binary tree data order left right
tree set easily searched numbers based location compared previous nodes
binary tree children ordered right side greater current node left less equal current node
binary tree value node n greater value every node n left subtree less every value n right subtree
binary search tree finite set nodes either empty consits root two disjoint binary trees call left right subtrees
similar binary tree keys nonempty left subtree right subtree smaller larger key root subtree values all nodes left subtree node less node value values all nodes right subtree node greater node values
set numbers arranged links node contain two pointers elements node left parent smaller node right larger recursive implementation implies traversed order output would sorted
binary search tree special binary tree arranged every left child node contains value less parent every right child node contains value greater parent
binary tree special organization data left child element less right child larger
tree smaller values located left parent node larger values located right parent node
binary search tree special tree node two children labeled left child right child
binary tree node unique key left child node values less node right child node higher values node
binary search trees fundamental data structure used construct abstract data structures sets multisets associative arrays
