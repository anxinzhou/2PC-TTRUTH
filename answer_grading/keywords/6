running checking runs true tests first
condition always body executes least statement true
met never always loop whereas regardless least loops executed block conditions statements
running test always loop performs
condition tested loops statement tests
beginning end terminates loop
always body loop executes least
evaluates always loop decides bottom expression top executes needs least
condition piece always checking least code statement first
condition however place loop first time checking 1 fails atleast passes
