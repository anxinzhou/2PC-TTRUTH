hierarchy nodes sorted particular order node ancestor except root children except leaves
tree finite set one nodes specially designated node called root remaining nodes partitioned disjoint sets sets tree
tree finite set one nodes specially designated node called root
connected undirected graph without cycles
data structure contains root internal nodes external nodes node references another node means pointers pass reference root base tree parents leaf node end tree points null
tree series nodes node links nodes
infinite set nodes root descendants addition leaf
set one nodes hierarchically organized one special ã â å rootã â â node
tree finite set one nodes specially designated node called root
one nodes hierarchy starting root branching like tree subtrees
tree data structure nodes linked hierarchical manner
grouping data parent child structure
list numbers list made comparing values nodes already tree adding appropriate spot list made nodes left right pointers
tree branched data structure nodes leaves special node called root parent node however like all nodes 2 nodes links namely one right one left
organizes data nonlinear hierarchical form items one successor partitioned root node subsets general subtrees root
tree finite set one nodes specially designated node called root remaining nodes partitioned n gt 0 disjoint sets n plus 1 element set tree
finite set nodes starts root terminates leaves
set data arranged pointers element many pointers two pointers point element
tree data structure one data nodes contains data node number attached child nodes creating branched structure trees named
finite collection nodes starts element called root children children children get leaves last elements children
nonlinear two dimensional data structure
finite set one nodes root node all nodes split trees lesser value root
finite number nodes one root node node certain number children nodes child also tree
type data structure element attached one elements directly beneath
