array limited n size order run also time list based like
linearly memory items instead blocks store linked list individual based
size preferred restrictions list based
array complicated slightly keep would implementation front preferred track both need rear list based
queues array way complicate things list extent based
declaration means limitation size also versatile less list code efficient based
prefered first last insertion keep size deletion quickly element pointers list set based done
issues drift array space rightward shifting due constant fix requires preferred data list queue based
preferable queues stacks similar lists size adjusted linked
all array keep preferred track count based
defined size list
dequeue sets depending need modify complexity all space horrid elements list based enqueue upon constant would implementation another causing large array data time shift pointers
best losing head tail dynamically kept especially lists track grown without queue list
better much simpler run time list based
initially memory lessened usage limits que become increased list large based
fixed based size list
dynamic size needs declared list
use best back maintain keep easier implementatoin memory front track bases uses list pointers
dynamically restrictions list grow fewer based
allocation memory issue preferred list based
queues allow size preferred solutions list based
array think size based base fixed worry list flaxible batter
queues array dont need elements list shift based like
memory constricted based list
