traverse both directions
doubly linked list delete node without traverse list
doubly linked list allows delete node without traversing list establish trailing pointer
doubly linked list allows traverse list either direction node points successor well predecessor
doubly linked lists traverse backwards though still cannot access data point list shorter traverse backwards
traverse list front back back front
traverse list reverse
doubly linked lists traversed both directions
double linked lists require space per node elementary operations expensive often easier manipulate allow sequential access list both directions
traverse forwards backwards nodes
point both forwards backwards
go backwards linked list access previous data easier without keep track previous item
doubly linked lists allow backward movement nodes
double pointers node point forwards backwards making little easer get need
ability backtrack list
move forwards backwards double linked list basic moves forwards
advantage node points bothe predecessor successor special cases insertion deletion
node points both predecessor successor
doubly linked list pointers both directions allows access back front well front back
doubly linked list traversed either direction normal linked list traversed start finish
double linked list often easier manipulate allow sequential access list both direction
given node list one navigate easily either direction
traverse list both forward backwards
doubly linked list allows back node rather go entire list
