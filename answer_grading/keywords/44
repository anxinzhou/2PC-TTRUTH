both traverse directions
delete doubly traverse node without linked list
trailing delete pointer doubly establish allows node without traversing linked list
direction successor well doubly traverse allows node predecessor linked either points list
backwards shorter doubly traverse though lists point cannot data linked access still list
traverse back list front
traverse reverse list
linked doubly lists both traversed directions
operations double space allow sequential easier elementary lists expensive node both often manipulate linked directions access require per list
nodes backwards traverse forwards
backwards both forwards point
backwards go item easier keep previous data without track linked access list
nodes allow backward doubly lists movement linked
backwards easer double little get point node need making forwards pointers
backtrack list ability
move backwards double moves basic linked forwards list
successor insertion deletion special node predecessor cases points bothe advantage
successor node both predecessor points
back well doubly allows front both linked access directions list pointers
start finish direction linked doubly normal traversed either list
double direction allow sequential easier both often manipulate linked access list
direction given navigate easily node list either one
backwards forward traverse both list
entire back rather doubly allows node linked go list
