number log nodes n
log steps n
levels height number tree
height tree
criteria search given n would elements take find steps 2
log n
depends current left go root step location node larger right looking else one smaller
n tree binary levels 2
1 n node number search function steps
given n would elements take 2
log n
log n
log n
best progressing linear n items right linked search children one constructed root 1 downwards worse traversal tree case log full list poorly way binary would last instance efficiently time number scenario
number nodes n
way tree anywhere n depending log could steps ordered
log n
best worst root step 1 tree case ie position node number farthest levels scenario
3 steps cases
nodes n tree total log number equals
tree generations number levels steps
tree binary node number search levels find takes steps
visiting visit subtree left root three node right go steps
log n
