overall program means performance better faster amounts large data
passing original program needed reference memory limits
copying passing value overhead reference pass amounts large data
rather maintaining efficient references address used objects access object often compiler functions allows syntax large
copying value performance good overhead reference reasons pass amounts large data
passed original value variable
stuff copies
functions memory space variables
data large need
variable function passed stored reference data directly
ability function access â called argument gives data
ability function access â called argument gives data directly
variable online function efficient used value changes new elsewhere
copy make waste memory
copying passing value typical reference eliminates pass amounts large data
copying function space passing computing gives permission size time also called memory arguments argument reference pass large wasted directly
caller access also modifying allows gives data directly
overall modify variable less overhead directly
variable function original referenced called modified directly
ability function access argument gives caller data directly
ability function access called argument gives caller data directly
passed value less using overhead large numbers especially
copying items space passed entire time needed point execution memory data large reducing
making time copy execution amounts instead improves modified data large directly
