program better means performance overall faster copy data amounts large
program reference needed passing memory limits original change
pass reference value eliminate passing data copying overhead amounts large
pass functions rather compiler address object syntax allows would often maintaining used references access objects large efficient
pass reference performance value eliminate reasons data copying overhead amounts good large
value alter variable original passed
stuff make copies
use space functions variables unessesary memory copy
amonts copy data need large elimitates
reference directly stored variable data change passed function
caller찾 called ability argument data 창 gives modify access function
caller찾 called ability argument data 창 gives modify directly access function
value inside outside variable changes elsewhere online used new function efficient
memory copy another make waste
pass reference value typical passing data copying amounts eliminates large
pass computing space size also copying directly function reference edit memory argument gives arguments wasted large called passing time permission read
modifying caller allows data also gives directly access
overall variable overhead modify directly less
modified variable called referenced original directly function
caller ability argument data gives modify directly access function
called caller ability argument data gives modify directly access function
value especially using numbers overhead less passed large
entire space reducing needed amout memory point items data copying execution time without passed large
improves modified instead data copy execution making time amounts directly large
