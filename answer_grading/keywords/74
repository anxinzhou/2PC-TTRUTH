latest array modified called upon keep static elements original retains declared
array program outside specific size static cannot accessed created also grow arrays
initialized terminates called destroyed static created declared function arrays
non static cannot c initialized
remains array program static throughout execution declared
array complier called static ignore declared comes line
program array scope pass reference available within static whereas declared whole
array predetermined size static cannot altered
static declared changed arrays one altered
array reinitialize stored calls static default elements declared values function retain
array causes initialized 0 static declared set anything
end array character static null
normal static cannot changed arrays
array functions outside passing static class accessed method argument without declared
scope array static class allowing might remain arrays recycled
acted unless array automatic scope uninitialize cleared uninitialized across called upon outside specific static terminate later explicitly change local objects
already knows defined program array start non assigned static whereas length later declared arrays one
forced unless array reinitialize initialize non must otherwise call static every function
automatic arrays array modified initial call static reset retains values function ends
end array called static every class lost data time keeps initialized values function one
array constant called way static say another used declared function const
array delcared constant within static manipulated declared values remain const
array static cannot data changed
finish array functions terminates instances available call static memory leaving terminate original parent new removed standard arrays function
