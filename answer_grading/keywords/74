array declared static retains modified elements called upon latest elements modified array declared static keep original elements
static array specific size cannot grow also static arrays cannot accessed outside program created
arrays declared static created initialized function called destroyed function terminates
static initialized non static cannot c
array declared static remains throughout execution program
static array called declared complier ignore static line comes
static array available whole program whereas array static available within scope declared pass reference
static array predetermined size size cannot altered
arrays declared static changed one declared static altered
array declared static retain values stored elements function calls reinitialize default values
array declared static causes anything initialized set 0
static array null character end array
static arrays cannot changed normal arrays changed
array declared static accessed outside method declared without passing argument functions class
static array class scope allowing remain arrays might recycled
array static change uninitialize called later unless explicitly acted upon terminate change across objects automatic local array cleared uninitialized called later outside specific scope
one declared static one already defined program knows length array start whereas non static arrays declared assigned later
non static array must reinitialize every function call static array initialize unless otherwise forced
static array retains modified values function call automatic arrays reset initial values function ends
static array one keeps values initialized every time class function called data lost function end
array declared static used function called constant array static another way say const
values array delcared static remain constant array declared const values within array manipulated
data static array cannot changed
standard arrays terminate functions call finish static array removed memory parent function terminates leaving available functions new instances original function
