element scans largest selects place elements respect one increment list places sorted scan front smallest next
lowest sort searches second item value swaps selection array next first
element according largest value needed swap front data
sort algorithm two smaller elements element divides first one list selection bigger compares half lists puts sorting
repeat elements assume separate one run iterate list find sorted section smallest next integers
sort element second selects sorts list selection smallest
till element sort item items place respect continue end left already smallest collection select
lowest sort piece moves held one starts increments process selection unsorted highest spot looking structure scrolls data
sort element largest elements sorts finding selection compares smallest works
sort case elements recursive repeatedly selection sorted smallest way method half divide usually sorting
moves place middle checks goes value given list less proper greater accordingly
lowest sort element pivot selection places point finds set data
sort element seeking right one value time selection iterates current least replacing array
sort times traverses several value put found selection output sorted unsorted array looking beginning performed smallest
largest value list runs finds smallest appropriate puts position
right less left number larger values numbers
last item largest swaps takes unsorted array
switches smaller decreasing comparing comes one object range previous objects sees way back finishes last first two looks middle next selecting greater
item two largest arrays selecting sorts goes list selection sorted unsorted complete placing steps array works certain going
sort smaller leaving right one value list pulling selection bigger left values works side
sort searches element largest new selection places point organization smallest remaining data
sort element second one sorts time selection list finds key array next location puts smallest first
element compare swap 2nd greater
element switches selects list correct smallest next position
