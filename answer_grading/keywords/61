levels tree away number height farthest root leaf
leaf depth furthest
root nodes number
root distance deepest leaf
generations levels number tree
nodes two say begin youre thats one intensity add 4 node current height children
nodes depth levels minimum 8 3 tree number height
nodes longest number path root leaf
nodes tree number height path root leaf
equal nodes levels node number terminal root
generations levels number tree
depth many tree height deep subtrees layers
generations number tree
nodes longest number path root leaf
levels distinct number separation
nodes levels tree height many
branches inverted elements connections normally often drawn called top root trees
