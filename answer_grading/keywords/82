link list grow infinite size array fixes size
advantage linked lists limited size like arrays
link lists dont fixed size
linked lists variable size arrays fixed size
linked lists definite size big small needed allocate extra memory elements need arrays size must defined
linked list dynamic size array fixed size takes allot extra operations increase size
predetermine list size arrays linked list ability large want adding memory needed
main advantage linked list size adjusted runtime
linked lists able grow size elements added list
linked lists confined specific size elements added removed far easier also easier traverse
predetermined length
inserts linked list far cheaper insert array array all items one inserted must shifted linked list pointers replaced
linked lists may dynamically grown
linked lists dynamic change added subtracted easily linear memory arrays pre specified size cast certain amount disk space makes insertion arrays difficult all elements must shifted reach end array done even data input linked lists run problems
linked lists indefinite size whereas arrays specific size
linked lists predefined length thus virtually unlimited items list
grow dynamically unlike fixed size array
add many nodes like without specify list size array gets big copy entire contents another larger array get room
linkded list fixed size arrays fixed size
linked lists dynamic size arrays static size
linked lists memory constraint total memory
primary advantage linked lists arrays ability become larger smaller data added removed list whereas arrays may waste memory small data sets run space large data sets
array fixed size link list flexible adding deleting element
resizeable
