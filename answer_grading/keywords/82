fixes infinite list size link array
advantage arrays size lists limited linked
size fixed link lists dont
variable arrays size fixed lists linked
elements need arrays defined size needed definite small lists big memory extra linked
operations list size takes fixed allot extra array linked dynamic
adding ability arrays list size needed memory linked want large
runtime adjusted advantage main list size linked
able elements size list lists added linked
removed elements specific size far also lists easier added linked confined
predetermined length
cheaper items inserted insert one shifted list far pointers replaced array inserts linked
linked grown lists dynamically
problems arrays space elements easily difficult memory amount done dynamic subtracted shifted end pre lists cast added makes array data certain linear disk insertion reach size even specified linked
arrays specific linked size whereas lists indefinite
thus predefined items unlimited list length virtually lists linked
dynamically size fixed array grow
contents nodes list size entire gets larger big room array many
fixed list arrays size
arrays static size lists linked dynamic
total lists memory constraint linked
ability smaller arrays advantage removed space list primary small lists larger memory added sets linked data large
adding element deleting size list fixed link array flexible
