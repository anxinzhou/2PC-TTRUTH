type char null n element end
variable char basically non command key keyboard press string collection letters numbers stored together used later comonly strings used words chars used less opperations performed useful way
programmer must provide null terminating character string characters using type char must also ensure array large enough contain input string characters null terminating character
string characters followed null statement type string example string
string contains word char contain phrases string characters
string variable single entinty letters combined one char letter assigned memory value variable assigned e char 0 char 1
string contains null character end string makes easily possible get string length char array virtually unlimited length therefore size must declared limited
array characters stores null character end
read string characters also read white space read characters declared char read characters white space
character arrays terminate whitespace including spaces strings terminate encounter new line character
difference string declared variable type char char included array versus string characters read variable
array strings reads string literals meaning anything within quotes char array reads string individual character
character arrays call individual letters string array call words
character array end line character end
type char may contain null value last element whereas type string
variable type string terminating character 0 end
one type string extra string member 0 end
string variable size function calls available character array usually static size
string char adds null value end string
char array needs end character signature made characters separate string object value user enters
variable type char character stored different memory address accessed easly string character easy able access character string
string passed array char individual characters stored manipulated although word stored string variable stored one word individual characters
string variable change size passed functions value whereas type char cannot change size passed functions reference
string type string acts single object individual char entities accessible specific string class functions char array less robust allows direct access specific char entities
