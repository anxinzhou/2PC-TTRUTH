visit times traverse tree size three order n node time running 3n
left root begins traversal tour tree visits node sides euler bottom right
visit according value order data
shows use functions siblings tree descendents contains type algorithm also alternative sorting ancestors children parents
start naming around root see tree node circle _whole_
vistit visit children parent
start left root traveling way till ever right along visiting return child
all visited siblings root first step terminal tree node traversing repeating parent child traverses children
iteratively pointer traversal tour tree node track euler keeps function
naming outside travel tree edge node clockwise
root children
left visit tree sub bottom parent go children
tour rubber tree shape euler style traverses band
left side right parent cupping starting children parents one visit nodes involves traversal navigating tree bottom top first specific tour moving way allows along next visited node progresses euler child following
order runs children parents
left proceeds root step side starts repeat order previous tree visits node right
backup left root travel side repeat reaching leftmost right rightmost farthest child children
left puts preorder tree order front postorder node right parent child
left nodes root traversal tree order traveral euler right looking put go inorder like
visited left around root begins traversal outside times tree 3 travels element euler bottom right
all straight root traversal tour tree starts leaf repeats euler elements traversed branch traverses one
traversals around variations root traversal tour working tree order every seen visits node pre counterclockwise euler post starting
answered
left around back last like traverse tree kind right top go going children
