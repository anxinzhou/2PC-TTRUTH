data structure storing items accessed last first order implemented three ways
stack abstract data type based principle last element inserted stack first element removed stack
stores set elements particular order
adt whose recently inserted item first item removed retrieved property called last first lifo items enter leave stack top
list top last item added modified
stack data structure uses push insert item pop remove ad item stack use last first structure inserting removing items
data structure stores data using lifo
stack similar array allow random access stacks allow user retrieve last item put stack last fist
stores set elements particular order stack principle last first means last element inserted first one removed
stack adt stores set elements particular order
data type stores set elements certain order last first
data structure moves elements last first
stores set elements last first order
list added removed top
stack abstract data type operates last first basis storing list objects support least pure stack peeking element without removing rest stack first
stores set elements particular order based principle last first lifo
object list stores elements particular order first object inserted bottom last object top first object last object
adt stores set elements particular order stack principles lifo last item inserted list first
abstract data type stores set elements particular order
collection data executed order last first
stack data structure allows data members added removed one time order last first structure
stores set element particular order
list element first one removed last one inserted
data structure puts elements list allows user access last element
