traverse tree find node node children simply delete otherwise set node data equal data one children set pointer child null
first attaching elements node deleting alternate nodes deleting node delete node
delete node tree link nodes parents children node
must delete information node contains free memory garbage collect also delete pointer node parent points node wish delete
replace node largest element left subtree replace smallest element right subtree
traverse tree till find node wanting delete node children delete node children delete find left children attach root delete node
link deleted left child deleted parent left child pointer
way delete node binary search tree first take root see nodes coming root delete nodes set root null
remove element tree move next highest element left place
delete node
deletion node depends upon children avl binary search tree assuming avl tree node deleted children set pointer null left child right child exclusively child replaces deleted node two children left child right sub tree right child left subtree replace
node leaf set parent pointer null delete single child set parent pointer child delete two children set node one middle children remove child previous position leaf rightmost child left subtree leftmost child right subtree
binary search tree must first establish proper replacement node delete usually child soon deleted node replacement node found simply reassign node going deleted deleted node usurped remove deleted node memory may used
all depends node located child deleted node inside tree must replaced another node works place
node children delete right away otherwise put either furthest right node left side furthest left node right side place perform node guarantee children get handled properly
create temp node set temp values node head null case head node list set head equal temp delete temp
searching tree find node replacing link node greatest child node left subtree least child node right subtree
set nodes null point anything use delete opertator clear space memory
must first traverse tree find appropriate value must make sure node leaf node delete pointer specific node
node leaf set parent pointer null node tree must replace node one tree either largest left tree smallest right tree done recursively needed
node leaf simply deallocated deleted memory parent reference changed null node single child pointer made point child deleting node node two children easiest solution may copy node entire subtree new array tree delete node all descendants add elements taken subtree back main tree
answered
cannot delete node cause node 2 children
