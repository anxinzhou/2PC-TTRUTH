new right deleting node subtree left max set parent leaf root child else null
equal otherwise simply one pointer node tree child set children data
nodes attaching elements deleting node delete first
nodes parents node tree delete children
wish information must pointer node also collect points memory garbage parent contains
element largest right node subtree left smallest
till wanting node find tree delete left children root traverse attach
deleted pointer left parent child
nodes binary search node delete tree way coming root first
remove element place tree left highest next
node delete
deleted exclusively avl binary search replaces right two sub pointer children node tree left assuming subtree deletion child depends
previous two middle right one pointer node delete left subtree leftmost position parent set children rightmost child single leaf
remove deleted binary search used usurped proper found node tree soon going memory replacement simply child usually
depends deleted place node tree works replaced child located
guarantee place right otherwise node delete furthest left properly away handled children side
equal case head list node temp delete set values null
right node find tree left subtree link searching least replacing greatest child
nodes space delete point use memory anything set clear
sure specific value pointer node tree appropriate leaf
largest right one pointer recursively node tree left needed set parent done smallest leaf
deleted elements entire node memory parent new null back simply made child leaf two descendants main deleting easiest pointer changed array children solution subtree tree reference taken single
