list based preferred constrained fix size fall takes memory node least two parts item pointer
list based preferred stack create limited size increase decrease size needed
array based prevents push operation adding item stack stack size limit size array reached list base much simpler write fixed size
array based faster easier keep track less complexity code
list based use fixed size like array would
usually linked list fixed size know want set max size array better
list based allows flexablity size stack
linked lists preferred implementing stacks limited set number elements
list based implementation preferred since big 1 efficient
linked list implementation preferred way list moved along without iteration
list size determined
linked list takes less memory scalable
list based list grown dynamically head node easily accessible
list based nodes easier work traversed easier
list based lower processing overhead nearly unlimited space due linked list design
list based grow shrink dynamically unlike fixed size array
list based arrays become full lists grow shrink needed
list bases implentation preferred one main reasons list fixed size
array preferred linked list implementation requires extra space store pointers space allocated dynamically list based takes time
link list preferred makes pushing elements easier limit memory number elements
list based implementation much easier implement allows stack scale necessary therefore preferred implementation
array based implementation requires less memory list based inceasing size resizeable array waste storage time
array based stack would need pre determine size list increase decrease size however want
list based implementation preferred list flexible array
