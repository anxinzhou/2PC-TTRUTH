item two based fall parts pointer list size takes node fix constrained preferred memory least
based create list size needed preferred limited stack
adding item simpler based base limit reached stack size list fixed much push prevents array operation
track based complexity less easier code faster array
based list size fixed array
list size max fixed better array know linked want usually
based list size allows stack
stacks elements implementing preferred lists limited set number linked
based efficient list preferred big 1 implementation
along moved list iteration way preferred implementation linked
determined list size
scalable list less takes memory linked
grown based head dynamically list node easily accessible
nodes traversed based list easier
due based space design list unlimited overhead processing nearly linked lower
based dynamically list size fixed array
based arrays list needed full lists
main one list size fixed bases preferred reasons implentation
based space dynamically list takes time pointers preferred implementation extra array linked requires allocated
elements limit pushing list link preferred memory easier number makes
based list much preferred easier implementation allows therefore necessary stack
storage based list less size time memory implementation array requires
based however size list array want stack
based list preferred implementation array flexible
